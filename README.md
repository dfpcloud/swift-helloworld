# Swift HelloWorld App Overview
This project contains a simple Swift hello world application that can be deployed to Bluemix or run locally on your [macOS](http://www.apple.com/osx/) or [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) system.  This sample application creates a basic server that returns an HTML greeting to the client.  Please note that this is not a production-ready application.  Instead, it is for educational purposes to learn about the types of applications you can develop using the Swift programming language.

## Application Requirements
To compile and run this sample application on your system, you need to install the [Swift compiler](https://swift.org/download/) for your platform. Please note that the Swift language is evolving and changing rapidly. The latest version of this Swift application works with the `3.1` version of the Swift binaries. You can download this version of the Swift binaries by following this [link](https://swift.org/download/).

If you are interested in manually deploying the application to Bluemix, you'd need to install the Cloud Foundry [command line](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) and Bluemix [command line](http://clis.stage1.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html) on your system.  Once it is installed, you can use it to [authenticate and access](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/index.html#getting-started) your Bluemix organization(s) and spaces.  You can find further details on how to deploy this sample application to Bluemix in the following sections.

## Run the app locally
Once you have installed the Swift compiler and cloned this Git repo, you can now compile and run the application. Go to the root folder of this repo on your system and issue the following command:
```
$ swift build
```
You should see an output similar to the following:
```
Compile Swift Module 'LoggerAPI' (1 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'Socket' (3 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'HeliumLogger' (2 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'Configuration' (7 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'CloudFoundryEnv' (5 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'HerokuConfig' (1 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'CloudFoundryConfig' (2 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'AmazonConfig' (1 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'Utils' (2 sources)
Compile Swift Module 'Server' (1 sources)
Linking ./.build/debug/Server
```
Once the application is successfully compiled, you can run the executable that was generated by the Swift compiler:
```
$ .build/debug/Server
```
You should see an output similar to the following:

```
Server is listening on port: 8080
```

To connect to the server, you can use the browser of your preference (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, etc.) to point to the following URL: `http://<hostname>:8080/`, where `<hostname>` is the hostname or the IP address of the system where you are running the sample app.  If the browser is running on the same system, you can use localhost as the value for the hostname.  After you access the server, the browser should render an HTML page with the following message:

```
Hello from Swift on Linux!
```
